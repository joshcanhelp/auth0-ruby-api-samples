## Intro 
These samples demonstrate how to create an API with Ruby which only permits access to resources if a valid **access token** is included. This verification is done by validating the signature and claims in a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by Auth0.

These samples do not demonstrate how to sign a JWT but rather assume that a user has already been authenticated by Auth0 and holds an access token for API access. For information on how to use Auth0 to authenticate users, see [the docs](https://auth0.com/docs).

To go to the sample you are interested in, navigate to the root folder.

This repo is supported and maintained by Community Developers, not Auth0. For more information about different support levels check https://auth0.com/docs/support/matrix .

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like
  * Google
  * Facebook
  * Microsoft
  * Linkedin
  * GitHub
  * Twitter
  * Box
  * Salesforce
  * etc.

  **or** enterprise identity systems like:
  * Windows Azure AD
  * Google Apps
  * Active Directory
  * ADFS
  * Any SAML Identity Provider

* Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)
* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts) with the same user
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and create user identity flow securely
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in
* Pull data from other sources and add it to user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules)

## Create a free Auth0 account
